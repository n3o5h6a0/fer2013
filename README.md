# fer2013
The code is to open the fer2013.csv dataset from kaggle.com in images using matlab, this function works by changing the number of images in line 3 the csv file should have no sting what so ever. There for if you downloaded the file lately delete the first row and the column for emotions and usage and just stretch the pixle column out. Finally hope this function helps
